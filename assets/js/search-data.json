Upcoming features Ability to control the “Split at:” slider values in the interface Option for skipping file copy and just instantly save them to a pdf saving a lot of time depending on the quantity of images Option to only copy the files over and not make a pdf with them Features Custom themes You can easily create a theme to override the colors of the interface, the app comes with 3 default themes, the “default” one is with everything default some colors might vary depending on your system the “STPDF-dark.ini” is a simple dark theme the “STPDF-cmder.ini” a theme inspired in cmder Deskewing images Altough ScanToPDF has the ability to deskew images it can’t do it withouth Tesseract, and tesseract is not shipped with the app, if you are on linux you can just install it with your package manager on windows you can find installers here Tesseract will also need to be in the environment PATH variable, to check it is available just open up a command line and type tesseract, if it displays info and it’s arguments then it’s working If you are having trouble doing this please visit the help section Localization This app is currently available in 3 languages: English Portuguese Spanish if you would like to help with the translation please see contributing",

First it creates a list(list1) of all files in the directory Now for each file in the list1 If the file has a know extension(PNG,JPG) then read it into a list(list2) in memory: If deskew(remove rotation) is true then Get the output rotation from tesseract providing the image in list2 Rotate the image and overwrite the old one in memory If save files is true then it saves it to the output directory and skips to the next image in list1 Else Append the image to the list2 And once again if save files is true it saves it to the output directory Final step is to make a pdf For image in list2 If split into multiple PDF’s is true Modify the list into a list(list2 but modified) of lists with the image handles For list in list2 Get the first item/image in the list and save it as a PDF Remove that entry from the list and append all the other images to the PDF But do you need all these steps? Some are optional and disabling might help speed up the whole process, let’s say: you only want to deskew images then disable make pdf in the gui you only want the PDF(s) not the rotated images then disable image copy you can learn more about this in App performance",
