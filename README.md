### Notes:

**If it fails to run locally use on console `chcp 65001`**

1. Changes to the head and nav to localize menu titles can be seen in [commit#a336c5530ca766f036c958992f94b83c84ad14e2](https://github.com/hallowf/STPDF-docs/commit/a336c5530ca766f036c958992f94b83c84ad14e2)
2. modifying the head and nav in _includes also produces the following warning:
    * `Missing i18n key: pt:node.title Using translation '' from default language: en Missing i18n key: pt:node.title Using translation '' from default language: en .........`
    * however everything seems to get translated at least locally
