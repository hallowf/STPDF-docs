Non-Personal Information collected is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system. We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below.

In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. Information transfer and storage Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information.

First it creates a list(list1) of all files in the directory Now for each file in the list1 If the file has a know extension(PNG,JPG) then read it into a list(list2) in memory: If deskew(remove rotation) is true then Get the output rotation from tesseract providing the image in list2 Rotate the image and overwrite the old one in memory If save files is true then it saves it to the output directory and skips to the next image in list1 Else Append the image to the list2 And once again if save files is true it saves it to the output directory Final step is to make a pdf For image in list2 If split into multiple PDF’s is true Modify the list into a list(list2 but modified) of lists with the image handles For list in list2 Get the first item/image in the list and save it as a PDF Remove that entry from the list and append all the other images to the PDF But do you need all these steps? Some are optional and disabling might help speed up the whole process, let’s say: you only want to deskew images then disable make pdf in the gui you only want the PDF(s) not the rotated images then disable image copy you can learn more about this in App performance",
