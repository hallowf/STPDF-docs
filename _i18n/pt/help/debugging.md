## Debugging

### STPDF-gui

The graphical user interface itself isn't great for understanding what's going wrong, but on the settings page you can set the log level,
if you switch it to debug and run the app in the console you will see a lot of output that might help you

To run the program from the console simply open up a console navigate to it's location and just type <code>STPDF.exe</code>

### STPDF-cli

Since you are already running the program from the console you can specify the log level in [optional arguments]()
